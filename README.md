ReactJS with Firebase Authentication Project
This project was created as part of the ReactJS with Firebase Authentication - React Level 2 course on Udemy. It showcases the integration of Firebase Authentication into a ReactJS application, implementing secure user authentication with a modern front-end framework.

Features
User Authentication:

Sign-up and Sign-in functionality using Firebase Authentication.
Password reset and email verification.
OAuth-based social logins (Google, Facebook, etc.).
Real-time Database Integration:

CRUD operations with Firebase Firestore.
Secure data handling with Firebase security rules.
Responsive Design:

Fully responsive UI built with modern CSS and design principles.
Mobile-first design approach for optimal user experience across devices.
State Management:

Efficient state management using React's context API.
Clean and maintainable component structure.
Technologies Used
ReactJS - Front-end library for building user interfaces.
Firebase Authentication - Secure authentication service by Firebase.
Firebase Firestore - NoSQL cloud database for storing user data.
React Router - Routing library for managing navigation in the app.
CSS Modules - Modular and reusable styles for each component.
React Context API - For global state management across the app.
Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I gained practical experience in:

Implementing Authentication: Learning how to set up and manage user authentication using Firebase, including handling edge cases such as password resets and email verifications.

Integrating Firebase with React: Understanding how to connect a React application with Firebase services like Firestore for real-time data handling.

Managing State Effectively: Utilizing React's Context API to manage global states efficiently across the application, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.

Building Responsive UIs: Applying CSS modules to create a responsive and modern user interface, enhancing the overall user experience.
