# ReactJS with Firebase Authentication Project
This project was created as part of the ReactJS with Firebase Authentication - React Level 2 course on Udemy. It showcases the integration of Firebase Authentication into a ReactJS application, implementing secure user authentication with a modern front-end framework.

## üöÄ Features

* __User Authentication:__


  * Sign-up and Sign-in functionality using Firebase Authentication.

  * Password reset and email verification.

  * OAuth-based social logins (Google, Facebook, etc.).

* Real-time Database Integration:

  * CRUD operations with Firebase Firestore.

  * Secure data handling with Firebase security rules.


* __Responsive Design:__


  * Fully responsive UI built with modern CSS and design principles.

  * Mobile-first design approach for optimal user experience across devices.


* __State Management:__


  * Efficient state management using React's Context API.

  * Clean and maintainable component structure.


## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:

* __ReactJS__ - Front-end library for building user interfaces.

* __Firebase Authentication__ - Secure authentication service by Firebase.

* __Firebase Firestore__ - NoSQL cloud database for storing user data.

* __React Router__ - Routing library for managing navigation in the app.

* __CSS Modules__ - Modular and reusable styles for each component.

* __React Context API__ - For global state management across the app.
